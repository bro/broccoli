Prerequisites
=============

Broccoli relies on the following libraries and tools, which need to be
installed before you begin:

    * Flex (Fast Lexical Analyzer)
       Flex is already installed on most systems, so with luck you can
       skip having to install it yourself.

    * Bison (GNU Parser Generator)
       This comes with many systems, but if you get errors compiling
       parse.y, you will need to install it.

    * OpenSSL headers and libraries
        For encrypted communication. These are likely installed,
        though some platforms may require installation of a 'devel' package
        for the headers.

    * CMake 2.8 or greater
       CMake is a cross-platform, open-source build system, typically
       not installed by default.  See http://www.cmake.org for more
       information regarding CMake and the installation steps below for
       how to use it to build this distribution.  CMake generates native
       Makefiles that depend on GNU Make by default.

Broccoli can also make uses of some optional libraries if they are found at
installation time:

    * Libpcap headers and libraries
       Network traffic capture library

Installation
============

To build and install into /usr/local:

    > ./configure
    > make
    > make install

This will perform an out-of-source build into the build directory using the
default build options and then install libraries into /usr/local/lib.

You can specify a different installation directory with

    > ./configure --prefix=<dir>

Or control the python bindings install destination more precisely with

    > ./configure --python-install-dir=<dir>

Run "./configure --help" for more options.
